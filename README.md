# Project SIGILL
<sub>Copyright (c) 2024 Sylv</sub>
An attempt to bring space-faring endeavours to Rust.

## License
Currently, SIGILL is ARR (All Rights Reserved). This may change in the future, especially as SIGILL gains contributors; however, SIGILL will likely never be Open Source.

## Price
Project SIGILL has no plans of publishing to game platforms. This is because it requires the latest Vulkan features that most computers do not support, let alone mobile devices and consoles. This game will never be ported to console.

## Compiling
You are free to compile and play the game (SIGILL) in its current state given that you do not redistribute the source code and/or binary executables.

### Dependencies
SIGILL requires the [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) available for Linux or Windows. SIGILL does not officially support macOS. SIGILL also requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (obviously).

#### Windows
On Windows, SIGILL requires the [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
